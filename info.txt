algorithms to cover: 
Deterministic Hill Climbing
1. Hill Climbing (Steepest version)
2. Hill Climbing (First-choice) --- NOT DETERMINISTIC
3. Tabu Search 
4. Enforced Hill Climbing (MAYBE)  ---- NOPE

Stochastic Hill Cimbing Techniques 
5. Hill climbing with random walk ---- NOPE
6. Hill climbing with random restarts 
7. Combination of 5 & 6 (MAYBE) ---- NOPE
8. Simulated Annealing (PREFERRED instead of 7)

Final improvement
9. Local Beam Search
10. Stochastic Local Beam Search
