# Generalized Local Search Tool
### (Course project for CS323 - AI)

## About the project:
This project is about local search algorithms like various variants of Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Gradient Descent etc. The implementations have been done in a general manner and hence can be employed for any kind of generalized problem that can provide the required functions. Also, two exempler problems, one in the continuous domain - N-Queens and one in the continuous domain - Real Estate Price prediction by (Gradient descent) have been included.

## Environment:
The only dependencies are matplotlib and numpy
`python -m pip install matplotlib`
`python -m pip install numpy`

## Part 1 - Discrete Domain:
This is the major focus of this project. A total of five local search algorithms have been implemented. The first 2 are deterministic and the final 3 are stochastic in nature. Tests can be done for the N-Queens problem.

### 1) Hill Climbing - Steepest [HC_S]
### 2) Tabu Seach [TS]
### 3) Hill Climbing - First-Choice [HC_FC]
### 4) Hill Climbing - Random Restarts [HC_RR]
### 5) Simulated Annealing [SA]

## Part 2 - Continuous Domain:
For the sake of completeness, one local search algorithm for problems in the continuous domain has been added i.e. Gradient Descent.

### 1) Gradient Descent

## Further Extensions:
